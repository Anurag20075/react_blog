      excerpt: "Learn the fundamentals of React 18 including new features like concurrent rendering, automatic batching, and Suspense improvements.",
      content: `React 18 introduces several groundbreaking features that revolutionize how we build user interfaces. This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know about the latest version of React.

Concurrent rendering is perhaps the most significant addition, allowing React to prepare multiple versions of the UI at the same time. This means better user experience with smoother interactions and improved performance.

Automatic batching is another game-changer, grouping multiple state updates into a single re-render for better performance. Previously, this only worked for React event handlers, but now it works everywhere.`,

      content: `CSS Grid has transformed how we approach web layouts, offering unprecedented control over both rows and columns. This article dives deep into advanced Grid techniques that will elevate your design skills.

We'll explore subgrid, a powerful feature that allows nested grids to participate in the sizing of their parent grid. This creates more cohesive and flexible layouts than ever before.

Container queries represent the future of responsive design, allowing components to respond to their container's size rather than the viewport. Combined with Grid, this opens up new possibilities for truly modular design systems.`,
